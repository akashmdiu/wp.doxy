Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.<\/li><li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/downloads\/\">Ghost Desktop App<\/a>&nbsp;for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/ghost.org\/pricing\">Ghost(Pro)<\/a>&nbsp;service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/TryGhost\">community<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"next-up-the-editor\">Next up, the editor<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing you&#8217;ll want to read about next is probably:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/axotic.themeix.com\/the-editor\/\">the Ghost editor<\/a>.
